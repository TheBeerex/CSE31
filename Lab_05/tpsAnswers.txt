	f) Click "Reset MIPS memory and registers"
TPS 2
1) ".data" holds global variables. ".word" stores n 32-bit quantities in successive memory words. ".text" is the code section
2) Line 10: If $t3 == $t0 then we jump to the finish protocol
3) Line 15: Jump to the fib protocol
4) After assembling, mark the "Bkpt" checkboxes next to the assembled code.
5) Click one of the "Run" options
6) On the right, find the register and look at its value (using your eyes). To modify it, click on the hex value and change it as desired.
7) n is stored $t3. 13th fib # is 233
8) syscall is used to request a service from the kernal using a service number/code.
