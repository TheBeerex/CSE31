TPS 1
1) 
	procedure: a series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner.
	function: a basic task of a computer, especially one that corresponds to a single instruction from the user.
	method: a particular form of procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.

4) line 12: j SUM. Jumps to line with label "SUM"
5) Yes, but it would make the code more difficult to read.
6) line 11: addi $ra, $zero, 0. Sets $ra to 0. Address value does not make sense.
7) "Error in : invalid program counter value: 0x00000000"
8) 0x00400020, or 4194336
9) Set $ra to 4194336
10) Now the function's address is different. Set $ra to 4194344 instead.
11) Use "jal SUM" instead of "j SUM" to jump and set $ra to the correct address.

TPS 2
1) The output should be 38, and it prints the expected output.
3) Used jal to store the return address for SUM. The return address in $ra is changed, so SUM won't return properly to MAIN.
4) Save register to memory temporarily. Then load it when needed.
5) $s0 is overwritten by a new value. This is a problem.
