Assignment 2
1) Output should be HELLO!hello! but is HELLO!hello!llo!
2) Output should be HI!hi! but is HI!hi!hellhi!
    Fixed by initiallizing the strings as empty strings and checking if s2[k] == 0 in order to not add unexpected characters
3) For some reason, a chunk of str1 is overwritten by str2, while str2 is still saved as str2, which causes it to append str2 to the back of the already unexpected str1.
